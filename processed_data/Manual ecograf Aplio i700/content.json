Intended Use \n1.1 \nIntended Use \nThe Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems Aplio i900 Model TUS-AI900, Aplio i800 Model \nTUS-AI800, and Aplio i700 Model TUS-AI700 are indicated for the visualization of \nstructures, and dynamic processes with the human body using ultrasound and to \nprovide image information for diagnosis in the following clinical applications: fetal, \nabdominal, intra-operative (abdominal), pediatric, small organs, trans-vaginal, trans-\nrectal, neonatal cephalic, adult cephalic, cardiac (both adult and pediatric), peripheral \nvascular, transesophageal, musculo-skeletal (both conventional and superficial), \nlaparoscopic and thoracic/pleural. \n1.2 \nTransducers \nFor the transducers that can be used with this system and their applications, refer to \nsubsection 5.6 \"List of Available Transducers\". \n1.3 \nIntended Patient Information \n• Age, health condition:  Not specified \nHowever, do not use this system if the patient's condition may lead to the patient being \nexposed to hazard. \n1.4 \nIntended User Profile \n• Only physicians or legally qualified persons who have received appropriate training \nBefore using this system, it must be ensured that the user has received sufficient \ntraining. \n1.5 \nOperating Principles \nThis diagnostic ultrasound system transmits ultrasound signals into the human body \nfrom a transducer and receives the reflected echoes from the human body using the \nsame transducer.  It then processes the received signals and displays them as images \non a display screen (LCD monitor). \nGating signals are sent from the scan control circuit through the transmission delay \ncircuit and are input to the reception circuit.  The reception circuit then generates the \ntransmission signals (electrical pulses) according to the gating signals. \nThese electrical pulses are applied to piezoelectric elements that convert the electrical \nsignals into mechanical vibrations in the transducer.  These mechanical vibrations, \nwhich are ultrasound signals, are then transmitted into the human body. \nThis system supports various scanning techniques, including convex, sector, and linear \nscanning. \nWhen the ultrasound signals transmitted into the human body encounter a substance \nwith different acoustic characteristics, they are reflected and return to the transducer as \nechoes.  Based on the time required for the ultrasound signals to return to the \ntransducer, the distance between the transducer surface and the reflecting substance \ncan be determined. \n",

Since the ultrasound beam attenuates in tissue, the \ndegree of amplification required generally increases as depth increases.  Regions of \nhigh reflection appear brighter, while regions of low reflection appear darker. \nAn M-mode image (cross-sectional image) can be displayed together with a 2D-mode \nimage on the same screen through time-sharing control, allowing the user to perform  \nM-mode diagnosis while observing a 2D-mode image.  The system creates and displays \nreal-time 3D images as dynamic images (4D Imaging (2DA)) by performing ultrasound \n3D electronic scanning inside the body with the 2D electronic array transducers. \nIn color Doppler imaging, phase detection is performed in a receive signal processing \ncircuit to obtain I and Q signals.  These signals undergo frequency analysis with the \ncorrelational method in a color Doppler imaging circuit to produce the mean velocity, \nvariance, and power information of the blood flow.  These information items are \nassigned color signals and are represented as real-time color Doppler images. \nIn Doppler imaging, the signals output from the receive signal processing board are \nfrequency-analyzed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in a Doppler circuit to produce \nvelocity and power information.  A Doppler image is then displayed, plotting velocity on \nthe vertical axis, time on the horizontal axis, and representing power as brightness. \nThis system supports basic measurements including distance, time, angle, and trace, as \nwell as combinations of some basic measurements.  In addition, calculations based on \nthe measurement values can be performed for each region (circulatory system, OB, \netc.) using widely accepted empirical formulas.  The calculation results can be displayed \nas values, tables, or graphs. \nThis is a general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound system that supports a variety of \nexternal and internal scanning methods. \nIn addition, the system configuration can be changed in order to use the system as a \nspecialized cardiovascular diagnostic ultrasound system for visualizing cardiac \nanatomical abnormalities, analyzing blood flow characteristics, and evaluating structural \nand functional changes associated with myocardial infarction. \nThis system allows measurement of the stiffness of organs etc. using the following \nfunctions (option). \nDisplacement of body tissues in the depth direction generated by extremely small \nexternal force applied to the body surface is detected using the ultrasound pulse \nreflection method.  In this method, indices such as Young's modulus and the \npropagation velocity of shear waves (which is highly correlated with tissue stiffness) are \nmeasured and displayed. \nExternal force is applied using either of the following 2 methods. \n• Shear Wave Elastography : \nExternal force is applied using push pulses. \n• Strain Elastography \n: \nExternal force is applied by manual compression. \n \n",

Reference Signal Display \nIn the 2D, M, or M+2D (including Doppler) display modes, it is possible to display up to \ntwo types of reference signals, such as ECG or PCG signals.  Note that the option \nUSUR-AI900A is required for reference signal display. \nWARNING:  1. For protection against electric shock, confirm the \nfollowing items before use: \n \n• There are no abnormalities in the reference signal \ncables. \n \n• The cable combination used is correct. \n \n* The reference signal cable supplied with the  \nUJUR-AI900A/UJUR-AI901A is used. \n \n2. Connect the reference signal cables to the system before \nsetting the ECG electrodes on the patient.  Do not touch \nany conductive areas, including the grounding, while \nECG electrodes are attached to the patient.  If an \nelectrode or a reference signal cable connector touches \nany conductive area, including the grounding, the patient \nmight be electrocuted. \n \n3. Do not allow the ECG electrode to touch the patient's \nheart directly.  Doing so may lead to cardiac arrest. \n \n * The ECG unit is a type BF unit.  It is not designed for \ndirect contact with the heart. \n \n4. Remove the ECG electrodes from the patient before using \ndevices such as electric scalpels, high-frequency therapy \nequipment, electrostimulators, or electric defibrillators.  \nIn addition, when using such devices, do not allow \nultrasound transducers, PCG microphones, or pulse wave \nsensors to come into contact with the patient.  Doing so \nmay result in the patient receiving a burn injury or an \nelectric shock. \n \nCAUTION:  Information derived from reference signals should be used \npurely for reference.  Do not use waveforms or other reference \nsignal information for diagnosis or monitoring.   \nNote also that in patients with cardiac pacemakers or \nimplantable electrostimulators and in patients with arrhythmia, \nthe heart rate may not be calculated correctly. \n \nNOTE: \nDo not place the reference signal cable over the touch panel.

Needle Mark \nWhen a specified biopsy adapter is used, the corresponding needle mark can be \ndisplayed. \nContact your Canon Medical Systems service representative for details of the needle \nmark display ON/OFF switch. \nWhen performing biopsy procedures, take all required precautions to avoid tissue \ndamage, neurological injury, and infection.  Clinical procedures should be selected \nbased on specialized medical judgment. \nWARNING:  1. Ultrasound-guided biopsy procedures require a thorough \nunderstanding of ultrasound diagnosis and specialized \ntraining in biopsy procedures.  If biopsy procedures are \nperformed without sufficient knowledge or training, they \nmay be performed incorrectly, resulting in injury to the \npatient. \n \n2. In the situations listed below, the biopsy needle may fail \nto reach the target lesion.  Incorrect biopsy may harm the \npatient. \n \n(a) A defective biopsy adapter is used. \n \n(b) A biopsy adapter other than that specified is used. \n \n(c) The biopsy adapter is mounted incorrectly. \n \n(d) A biopsy needle that is unsuitable for biopsy is used. \n \n(e) A biopsy needle that does not match the biopsy \nadapter is used. \n \n(f) The operator continues the biopsy procedure when \nthe image is frozen. \n \n(g) The operator does not correctly observe the location \nof the needle tip. \n \n(h) The selected needle mark angle does not match the \nangle indicated on the biopsy adapter to be used. \n \n3. Keeping the following points in mind, carefully monitor \nthe target region and the needle tip while performing a \nbiopsy procedure. \n \n(a) During a biopsy procedure, the needle may deviate \nfrom the desired course due to the tissue \ncharacteristics or the type of needle.  In particular, \nneedles with small diameters may deviate to a greater \ndegree. \n \n(b) The biopsy target may shift due to unexpected patient \nmotion when the biopsy needle is inserted or due to \nrespiratory movement. \n \n(c) The needle mark displayed on the ultrasound image \nindicates the predicted course of the biopsy needle, \nnot the actual position of the biopsy needle.  It should \nbe used only for reference. \n",

Even though the biopsy target and the biopsy needle are \nidentified on the image, a biopsy procedure may not \nalways be successful due to dispersion of the ultrasound \nbeam.  This is especially true for fine tubular structures or \nother very small structures.  To avoid failure of the biopsy \nprocedure, observe the following precautions. \n \n(a) Do not rely solely on the echo of the needle tip on the \nimage.

Using MI/TI \n24.1 Using MI/TI (Outside the USA and Canada) \n24.1.1 Basic knowledge of MI/TI \n(1) Concerns related to bioeffects \nStudies have revealed that ultrasound with extremely high intensity is harmful to \nbody tissues.  This finding has generated concerns about the potential risk of \nbioeffects when new applications or diagnostic technologies become available. \n(2) Mechanical effects and thermal effects \nStudies have revealed that two different kinds of ultrasound characteristics affect \nhuman bodies: mechanical effects due to cavitation generated when the negative \npressure of ultrasound exceeds a certain limit and thermal effects caused by the \nabsorption of ultrasound in tissues.  The levels of these two effects are respectively \nrepresented by the following indices: MI (Mechanical Index) and TI (Thermal Index). \n(3) MI/TI values \nThe smaller the MI/TI values, the less significant the bioeffects. \n(4) Controlling the ultrasound output \nIn 1976, due to the rapid advances in diagnostic ultrasound technology and the \nproliferation of its applications, the FDA in the USA established limits for the \nacoustic output level for diagnostic ultrasound equipment (TRACK1) in order to \nensure the safety of patients.  Thereafter it has been mandatory for manufacturers \nto ensure that the acoustic output level is maintained below the specified limits \nwhen releasing new diagnostic ultrasound systems in the market. \nNOTE: \nIspta.3 may be represented as Izpta,α (α = 0.3 dB/cm/MHz) or Ispta,α  \n(α = 0.3 dB/cm/MHz) (IEC 60601-2-37). \nMaximum acoustic power specified by FDA (TRACK1) \nApplication \nIspta.3  \n(mW/cm2) \nIsppa.3 \n(W/cm2) \nMI \nPeripheral blood vessels \n720 \n190 \n1.9 \nCardiovascular systems \n430 \n190 \n1.9 \nFetal and other \n94 \n190 \n1.9 \nEyes \n17 \n28 \n0.23 \n",

Users are \ntherefore required to understand the bioeffects of \nultrasound and their causes.  \n(5) ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)  \nIt is required to practice ALARA when using ultrasound energy.  Practicing ALARA \nensures that the total energy level is controlled below a low enough level at which \nbioeffects are not generated while diagnostic information is being accumulated. \nThe total energy is controlled by output intensity and total radiation time.  The \noutput intensity necessary for examinations differs depending on the patient and \nthe clinical case. \nCAUTION:  It is strictly required that acoustic output be set based on \nthe ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle.  \nHowever, not all examinations can be performed with an \nextremely low level of acoustic energy.  Controlling the \nacoustic level at an extremely low level leads to low-quality \nimages or insufficient Doppler signals, adversely affecting \nthe reliability of the diagnosis.  However, increasing the \nacoustic power more than necessary does not always \ncontribute to an increase in quality of information required \nfor diagnosis, rather increasing the risk of generating \nbioeffects. \nUsers must take responsibility for the safety of patients \nand utilize ultrasound deliberately.  Deliberate use of \nultrasound means that output power of ultrasound must be \nselected based on ALARA. \n",

These parameters were developed as general indicators of risk \nfrom the thermal and mechanical effects of ultrasound waves.  They serve to \nindicate to the operator whether a particular setting of the system increases or \ndecreases the possibility of thermal or mechanical effects.  More specifically, they \nwere designed to assist in the implementation of the ALARA principle (refer to \nsubsection 24.1.6 \"Reminder\").

However, the Thermal Index is not \nthe same as temperature rise in the body for several reasons.  First of all, in order \nto provide a single display index to the user, a number of simplifying assumptions \nhad to be made.  The biggest of these was the use of the attenuating formula \ndescribed above, which is based on a much lower attenuation than the actual \nattenuation in most tissues in the body.  Scanning muscle or organ tissue, for \nexample, will produce a much higher attenuation than 0.3 dB/cm/MHz.  There were \nalso significant simplifications made for the thermal properties of tissue.  Therefore, \nscanning through highly perfused tissue, such as the heart or vasculature, will \nproduce significantly lower thermal effects than that suggested by the Thermal \nIndex. \nSimilarly, the Mechanical Index was derived to indicate the relative possibility of \nmechanical (cavitation) effects.  The MI is based on the derated peak rarefactional \npressure and the center frequency of the ultrasound wave (refer to subsection \n24.1.2 \"MI/TI display description\").  The actual peak rarefactional pressure is \naffected by the actual attenuation caused by tissue in the path between the \ntransducer and the focal point.  Again, all solid tissues within the body have higher \nattenuation than the prescribed 0.3 dB/cm/MHz value, and therefore, the actual \npeak rarefactional pressure will be lower than that assumed.  In addition, the actual \npeak rarefactional pressure will change depending on the region of the body being \nscanned. \nFor these reasons, the TI and MI displays should only be used to assist the \noperator in implementing ALARA during patient examinations.   \n24.1.8 References for MI/TI \nFor further information on measurement methods and MI/TI, refer to the following: \n(1) \"Acoustic Output Measurement Standard for Diagnostic Ultrasound Equipment, \nRevision 3\" issued by AIUM/NEMA in 2004 \n(2) \"Standard for real-time display of thermal and mechanical acoustic output indices \non diagnostic ultrasound equipment, Revision 2\" issued by AIUM/NEMA in 2004 \n(3) \"Bioeffects and Safety of Diagnostic Ultrasound\" issued by AIUM in 1993 \n(4) \"Medical Ultrasound Safety\" issued by AIUM in 1994 \n(5) \"Information for Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic \nUltrasound Systems and Transducers\" issued by FDA in 2008 \n(6) World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB), Conclusions \nand Recommendations on Thermal and Non-thermal Mechanisms for Biological \nEffects of Ultrasound.

This finding has generated concerns about the potential risk of \nbioeffects when new applications or diagnostic technologies become available. \n(2) Mechanical effects and thermal effects \nStudies have revealed that two different kinds of ultrasound characteristics affect \nhuman bodies: mechanical effects due to cavitation generated when the negative \npressure of ultrasound exceeds a certain limit and thermal effects caused by the \nabsorption of ultrasound in tissues.  The levels of these two effects are respectively \nrepresented by the following indices: MI (Mechanical Index) and TI (Thermal Index). \n(3) MI/TI values \nThe smaller the MI/TI values, the less significant the bioeffects. \n(4) Controlling the ultrasound output \nIn 1976, due to the rapid advances in diagnostic ultrasound technology and the \nproliferation of its applications, the FDA in the USA established limits for the \nacoustic output level for diagnostic ultrasound equipment (TRACK1) in order to \nensure the safety of patients.  Thereafter it has been mandatory for manufacturers \nto ensure that the acoustic output level is maintained below the specified limits \nwhen releasing new diagnostic ultrasound systems in the market. \nNOTE: \nIspta.3 is represented as Izpta,α (α = 0.3 dB/cm/MHz) (IEC 60601-2-37). \nMaximum acoustic power specified by FDA (TRACK1) \nApplication \nIspta.3 \n(mW/cm2) \nIsppa.3 \n(W/cm2) \nMI \nPeripheral blood vessels \n720 \n190 \n1.9 \nCardiovascular systems \n430 \n190 \n1.9 \nFetal and other \n94 \n190 \n1.9 \nEyes \n17 \n28 \n0.23 \n",

Users are \ntherefore required to understand the bioeffects of \nultrasound and their causes.  \n(5) ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable)  \nIt is required to practice ALARA when using ultrasound energy.  Practicing ALARA \nensures that the total energy level is controlled below a low enough level at which \nbioeffects are not generated while diagnostic information is being accumulated. \nThe total energy is controlled by output intensity and total radiation time.  The \noutput intensity necessary for examinations differs depending on the patient and \nthe clinical case. \nCAUTION:  It is strictly required that acoustic output be set based on \nthe ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle.  \nHowever, not all examinations can be performed with an \nextremely low level of acoustic energy.  Controlling the \nacoustic level at an extremely low level leads to low-quality \nimages or insufficient Doppler signals, adversely affecting \nthe reliability of the diagnosis.  However, increasing the \nacoustic power more than necessary does not always \ncontribute to an increase in quality of information required \nfor diagnosis, rather increasing the risk of generating \nbioeffects. \nUsers must take responsibility for the safety of patients \nand utilize ultrasound deliberately.  Deliberate use of \nultrasound means that output power of ultrasound must be \nselected based on ALARA. \n",

By accepting \nthis agreement and using the software you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and \ndisclose the information as described in the Microsoft Privacy Statement available at \n(aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the \nsoftware features. \n4. \nAuthorized Software and Activation. You are authorized to use this software only if you \nare properly licensed and the software has been properly activated with a genuine \nproduct key or by other authorized method. When you connect to the Internet while using \nthe software, the software will automatically contact Microsoft or its affiliate to confirm the \nsoftware is genuine and the license is associated with the licensed device. You can also \nactivate the software manually by Internet or telephone. In either case, transmission of \ncertain information will occur, and Internet, telephone and SMS service charges may \napply. During activation (or reactivation that may be triggered by changes to your device’s \ncomponents), the software may determine that the installed instance of the software is \ncounterfeit, improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes. If activation fails the \nsoftware will attempt to repair itself by replacing any tampered Microsoft software with \ngenuine Microsoft software. You may also receive reminders to obtain a proper license for \nthe software. Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or \nproperly licensed. You may not bypass or circumvent activation. To help determine if your \nsoftware is genuine and whether you are properly licensed, see (aka.ms/genuine). Certain \nupdates, support, and other services might only be offered to users of genuine Microsoft \nsoftware.  \n5. \nUpdates. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources, and \nMicrosoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates. The \nsoftware periodically checks for system and app updates, and may download and install \nthem for you. To the extent automatic updates are enabled on your device, by accepting \nthis agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any \nadditional notice.  \n6. \nGeographic and Export Restrictions. If your software is restricted for use in a particular \ngeographic region, then you may activate the software only in that region. You must also \ncomply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the \nsoftware, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further \ninformation on geographic and export restrictions, visit (aka.ms/georestrict) and \n(aka.ms/exporting). \n",

Refer to the support number provided with \nthe software. For updates and supplements obtained directly from Microsoft, Microsoft \nmay provide limited support services for properly licensed software as described at \n(aka.ms/mssupport). If you are seeking a refund, contact the manufacturer or installer to \ndetermine its refund policies. You must comply with those policies, which might require \nyou to return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a \nrefund. \n8. \nBinding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if You Live in (or if a Business Your \nPrincipal Place of Business is in) the United States. \nWe hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to \nresolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration \nbefore the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration \nAct (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral \narbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of \nappeal under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private \nattorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a \nrepresentative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings \nwithout the consent of all parties. \"We,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" includes Microsoft, the device \nmanufacturer, and software installer. \na. \nDisputes covered—everything except IP. The term \"dispute\" is as broad as it can \nbe. It includes any claim or controversy between you and the manufacturer or \ninstaller, or you and Microsoft, concerning the software, its price, or this agreement, \nunder any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, \nexcept disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, \nour, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights. \nb. \nMail a Notice of Dispute first. If you have a dispute and our customer service \nrepresentatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to the \nmanufacturer or installer, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT. If your dispute is with \nMicrosoft, mail it to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One \nMicrosoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. Tell us your name, address, how to \ncontact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at \n(aka.ms/disputeform). We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After  \n60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved. \nc. \nSmall claims court option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, and if you meet \nthe court’s requirements, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of \nresidence (or if a business your principal place of business) or our principal place of \nbusiness–King County, Washington USA if your dispute is with Microsoft. We hope \nyou’ll mail a Notice of Dispute and give us 60 days to try to work it out, but you don’t \nhave to before going to small claims court.  \nd. \nArbitration procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial \nArbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the software for personal or \nhousehold use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 USD or less whether or not \nyou are an individual or how you use the software, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). \nFor more information, see (aka.ms/adr) or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an \narbitration, submit the form available at (aka.ms/arbitration) to the AAA; mail a copy \nto the manufacturer or installer (or to Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft). In a \ndispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the \narbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person \nhearing will take place in your county of residence (of if a business your principal \nplace of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if \nyour dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same \ndamages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory \nor injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. \n",

The manufacturer or installer (or \nMicrosoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will promptly reimburse your filing \nfees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our \nlast written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your \ndispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an \"award\"), and \nthe arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, the manufacturer or \ninstaller (or Microsoft if your dispute is with Microsoft) will: (1) pay the greater \nof the award or $1,000 USD; (2) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; \nand (3) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) \nthat your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and \npursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amounts \nunless you and we agree on them. \n(ii) \nDisputes involving more than $75,000 USD. The AAA rules will govern \npayment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. \n(iii) \nDisputes involving any amount. If you start an arbitration we won’t seek our \nAAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees we reimbursed, \nunless the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper \npurpose. If we start an arbitration we will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s \nfees and expenses. We won’t seek our attorney’s fees or expenses from you \nin any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how \nmuch a dispute involves. \nf. \nMust file within one year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration \nany claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes — see Section 8.a.) \nwithin one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred. \ng. \nSeverability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to \nall or some parts of a dispute, those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in \ncourt, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 8 is \nfound to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of \nSection 8 still applies. \nh. \nConflict with AAA rules. This agreement governs if it conflicts with the AAA’s \nCommercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. \ni. \nMicrosoft as party or third-party beneficiary. If Microsoft is the device \nmanufacturer or if you acquired the software from a retailer, Microsoft is a party to \nthis agreement. Otherwise, Microsoft is not a party but is a third-party beneficiary of \nyour agreement with the manufacturer or installer to resolve disputes through \ninformal negotiation and arbitration. \n9. \nGoverning Law. The laws of the state or country where you live (or if a business where \nyour principal place of business is located) govern all claims and disputes concerning the \nsoftware, its price, or this agreement, including breach of contract claims and claims \nunder state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for \nunjust enrichment, and in tort, regardless of conflict of law principles. In the United States, \nthe FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.  \n10. \nConsumer Rights, Regional Variations. This agreement describes certain legal rights. \nYou may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or \ncountry. You may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the \nsoftware. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or \ncountry do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the \nbelow regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to \nyou:  \n",

Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a \nContributor: \na.for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or \nb.for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered \nSoftware, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its \nContributor Version); or \nc.under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. \nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any \nContributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). \n2.4. Subsequent Licenses \nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered \nSoftware under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a \nSecondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). \n2.5. Representation \nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original \ncreation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this \nLicense. \n",

Fair Use \nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of \nfair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents. \n2.7. Conditions \nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. \n3. Responsibilities \n3.1. Distribution of Source Form \nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You \ncreate or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform \nrecipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this \nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict \nthe recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form. \n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form \nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: \na.such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in \nSection 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy \nof such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than \nthe cost of distribution to the recipient; and \nb.You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it \nunder different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit \nor alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License. \n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work \nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You \nalso comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work \nis a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary \nLicenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License \npermits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such \nSecondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further \ndistribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary \nLicense(s). \n3.4. Notices \nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, \npatent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source \nCode Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent \nrequired to remedy known factual inaccuracies. \n",

Application of Additional Terms \nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability \nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on \nYour own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that \nany such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You \nhereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a \nresult of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional \ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. \n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation \nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or \nall of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) \ncomply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the \nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with \nall distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by \nstatute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill \nto be able to understand it. \n5. Termination \n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with \nany of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License \nfrom a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor \nexplicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor \nfails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You \nhave come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are \nreinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some \nreasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this \nLicense from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of \nthe notice. \n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding \ndeclaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor \nVersion directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all \nContributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. \n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license \nagreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or \nYour distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. \n6. Disclaimer of Warranty \nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any \nkind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the \nCovered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. \nThe entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should \nany Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the \ncost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an \nessential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License \nexcept under this disclaimer. \n",

Versions of the License \n10.1. New Versions \nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other \nthan the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each \nversion will be given a distinguishing version number. \n10.2. Effect of New Versions \nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under \nwhich You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent \nversion published by the license steward. \n10.3. Modified Versions \nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for \nsuch software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the \nlicense and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such \nmodified license differs from this License). \n10.4.

By contrast, the GNU General Public \nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free \nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This \nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software \nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to \nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by \nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to \nyour programs, too. \n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not \nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you \nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for \nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it \nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it \nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid \nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. \nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you \ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. \n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether \ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that \nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the \nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their \nrights. \n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and \n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, \ndistribute and/or modify the software. \n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain \nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free \nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we \nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so \nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original \nauthors' reputations. \n",

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free \nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the \nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any \npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. \n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and \nmodification follow. \nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE \nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains \na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed \nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, \nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" \nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: \nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, \neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another \nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in \nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not \ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of \nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program \nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the \nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program). \nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does. \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's \nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you \nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate \ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the \nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; \nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License \nalong with the Program. \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and \nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion \nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and \ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 \nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices \n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in \n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any \n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third \n    parties under the terms of this License. \n",

(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but \n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on \n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.) \nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If \nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, \nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in \nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those \nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you \ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based \non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of \nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the \nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest \nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to \nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or \ncollective works based on the Program. \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program \nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of \na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under \nthe scope of this License. \n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, \nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of \nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: \n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable \n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections \n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three \n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your \n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete \n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be \n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium \n    customarily used for software interchange; or, \n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer \n    to distribute corresponding source code.

However, as a \nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include \nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary \nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the \noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component \nitself accompanies the executable. \nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering \naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent \naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as \ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not \ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code. \n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program \nexcept as expressly provided under this License.

It also counts \n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence \n the version number 2.1.] \nPreamble \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. \nBy contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share \nand change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  \nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software \npackages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to \nuse it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or \nthe ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based \non the explanations below.  \nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General \nPublic Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of \nfree software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it \nif you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and \nthat you are informed that you can do these things.  \nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these \nrights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain \nresponsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  \nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the \nrecipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get \nthe source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to \nthe recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library \nand recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  \n",

Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should \nknow that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will \nnot be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  \nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish \nto make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining \na restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained \nfor a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this \nlicense.  \nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public \nLicense. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated \nlibraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for \ncertain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  \nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the \ncombination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. \nThe ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination \nfits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking \nother code with the library.  \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the \nuser's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software \ndevelopers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are \nthe reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \nlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  \nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible \nuse of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free \nprograms must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the \nsame job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free \nlibrary to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  \nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater \nnumber of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU \nC Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating \nsystem, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  \nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does \nensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the \nwherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close \nattention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the \nlibrary\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined \nwith the library in order to run.  \n",

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a \nnotice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed \nunder the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee \nis addressed as \"you\".  \nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be \nconveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to \nform executables.  \nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed \nunder these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative \nwork under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either \nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. \n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \nFor a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus \nany associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and \ninstallation of the library.  \nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they \nare outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and \noutput from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library \n(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on \nwhat the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  \n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you \nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each \ncopy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that \nrefer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License \nalong with the Library.  \nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option \noffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  \n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work \nbased on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of \nSection 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  \n• a) The modified work must itself be a software library. \n• b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you \nchanged the files and the date of any change. \n• c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties \nunder the terms of this License. \n• d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied \nby an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when \nthe facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event \nan application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and \nperforms whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  \n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is \nentirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires \nthat any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if \nthe application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square \nroots.) \n",

But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole \nwhich is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this \nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each \nand every part regardless of who wrote it.  \nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written \nentirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or \ncollective works based on the Library.  \nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with \na work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the \nother work under the scope of this License.  \n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this \nLicense to a given copy of the Library.

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work \nwith the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such \na work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope \nof this License.  \nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a \nderivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that \nuses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for \ndistribution of such executables.  \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, \nthe object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source \ncode is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the \nLibrary, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined \nby law.  \nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and \nsmall macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object \nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing \nthis object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  \nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the \nwork under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under  \nSection 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  \n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the \nLibrary\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that \nwork under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the \ncustomer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that \nthe Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If \nthe work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for \nthe Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. \nAlso, you must do one of these things:  \n• a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source \ncode for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be \ndistributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with \nthe Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object \ncode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to \nproduce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the \nuser who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be \nable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \n• b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable \nmechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the \nuser's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and \n(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as \nlong as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was \nmade with. \n• c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the \nsame user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than \nthe cost of performing this distribution. \n• d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, \noffer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \n• e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have \nalready sent this user a copy. \n",

Such a contradiction means you \ncannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  \n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single \nlibrary together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a \ncombined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of \nthe other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  \n• a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, \nuncombined with any other library facilities.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly \nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or \ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. \nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have \ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  \n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing \nelse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These \nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other \nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, \nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you \nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your \nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you \nmay not distribute the Library at all.

Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software \ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the \nauthor/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and \na licensee cannot impose that choice.  \nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the \nrest of this License.  \n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents \nor by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this \nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so \nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this \nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  \n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser \nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the \npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  \nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number \nof this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the \nterms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free \nSoftware Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose \nany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  \n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution \nconditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software \nwhich is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; \nwe sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of \npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing \nand reuse of software generally.  \nNO WARRANTY  \n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY \nFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN \nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES \nPROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER \nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED \nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. \nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH \nYOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL \nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  \n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING \nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR \nREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR \nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL \nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING \nBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR \nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO \nOPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY \nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  \n",

You can do so \nby permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary \nGeneral Public License).  \nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the \nstart of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file \nshould have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  \none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. \nCopyright (C) year name of author \nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or \nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public \nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either \nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. \nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The particular version of the Library \nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked \nVersion\". \n \n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the \nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code \nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are \nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. \n \n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the \nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data \nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the \nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. \n \n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. \n \n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License \nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. \n \n  2.

Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. \n \n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from \na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object \ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated \nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure \nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates \n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: \n \n  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the \n  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are \n  covered by this License. \n \n  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license \n  document. \n \n  4.
